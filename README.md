# TutorialFirebaseTriggerEmail
A tutorial by Isabelle Smart and Greyson Hansen on how to send emails from flutter using the Firebase Trigger Email Extension.
A walk through of the steps to initialize/setup the firebase trigger email extension, showing how an email can be sent directly through the firestore database with the extension, and the very basics of how to write flutter code to work with the trigger email extension. 
Resources we used: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73916737/how-to-setup-firebase-trigger-mail-and-cloud-functions 
https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/official/firestore-send-email The code that we used in flutter to send the email was heavily based off the code in here.
